  The true original intention of the Kamen Rider is to guard the "guardian" in justice. Whether it is the bloody Showa man or the new personality of the Heisei Knight, no accident is a tragedy. The power of the protagonist does not make them happy. Even if there is an early success, it will be sad later. Unlike the American hero concept, the protagonist does not get the power to defeat the villain and then embark on the peak of life, and then wait for the next wave of crisis, the American hero is more concerned about justice, is the justice of man.<br><br>
The knight is essentially a geek, but the difference is that they are not as addicted to their power as most geeks, but they ask themselves, when other geeks persecute ordinary humans, the knight protects humans more because of themselves. Mutual aid, once a human being or a human being, is more likely to be a revenge for turning yourself into such a villain. Showa is to transform people's tears. When you are a human or a monster, you don't want to be a geek. But you know that you can't be a human being. You will be excluded and even feared when you reveal your identity. See your love. People are hurt or even killed, using their anger on their own revenge, and slowly recovering themselves in the long process of revenge.
<br><br>
Heisei, although the way to become a knight is changeable or even random, but by the end of the story, the process of going through is painful, because they have lost too much.<br><br>
Compared with Showa, Heisei is more because he is human. Or I used to be a human being and set off to guard. In this process, the achievements of the peace are not as direct as those of the Showa men, but more like ordinary human beings will be lost and doubts, what are they guarding themselves, whether they are doing wrong now. These are caused by themselves. After all, the protagonist of the Showa man was not an ordinary person when he was an ordinary person (otherwise, the villain relies on you to make money for the transformation). The handsome Cavaliers are full of torture.<br><br>
The knight has always been fighting with the same people, because if the knight and the geek are of a nature from a human point of view, the knightâ€™s move is to know that their identity can still adhere to what they "guard". The focus is on guardian, they have been fighting for "guardian", so they are masked knights.</p>
