                                                      Currently, I'm a international Sophomore at Damien High School.
                                                      In my previous classmates unified view, I’m positive, outgoing
                                                        and humorous, but because my oral speaking ability is not good
                                                          enough, my real character is not shown yet. My favorite subject
                                                            is Physics and English but I’m not good at either
                                                            of them at all. What’s more, I’m not good at art related things.
                                                              However, I will persist and try to improve myself.I come
                                                              to study abroad because I want to get better education. Since
                                                              my childhood, I've been interested in the sky above us all
                                                              the time. The number of mysteries hidden in the world is just
                                                              like the numerous stars in the sky. My parents and my brother
                                                              all agree to me. However, I'm not pretty sure what do I really
                                                              want to do for my dream. So that's the question I think about
                                                              everyday.</pre>
